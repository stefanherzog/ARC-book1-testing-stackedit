# Chapter Summary

XXX. Do we need a summary here?


# Key Questions

What are the key questions you want to address?

Role of uncertainty in

- *dialectical bootstrapping* \parencites{herzog2009wisdom, herzog2013crowd, herzog2014think, phillips2015harnessing, phillips2015improving}; competing cognitive strategies [@herzog2015strategy; @vonhelversen2014haunted]

- the wisdom of the *inner crowd* [@herzog2014harnessing] more generally

- wisdom of the crowds in *signal detection tasks*; especially medical domain (Kurvers)

- wisdom of the crowds as social recommenders [@analytis2015you]

- *ignorant crowds* [@herzog2011wisdom]?




# Connection to Adaptive Cognition

How does your chapter connect to the overarching theme of adaptive cognition?

There is uncertainty about 

- which judgments to use, 
- how to use them (averaging, weighting, picking), and
- how many [@luan2015take; @mannes2014wisdom]


# Key Empirical Findings

What are the key empirical findings that you plan to report?


# Key Theories

What are the key theories that you plan to use?


# Key Theoretical Developments

What are the key theoretical developments of the chapter?


# Connection to Research Lines Outside of the book?

What lines of the research you will connect to outside the book?

- research on small/select crowds [@mannes2014wisdom]
